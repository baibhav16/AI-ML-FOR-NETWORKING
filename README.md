# AI-ML-FOR-NETWORKING

Objective : To detect XSS attacks using hybrid CNN + BiLSTM model .

Proposed Solution :  In this project, we use a hybrid deep learning architecture 
combining CNN for feature extraction and BiLSTM for learning sequential patterns. We 
tokenize input data at the character level to capture fine-grained syntactic patterns and train the 
model to distinguish between safe and malicious HTML inputs.
